                <h2>A little about me</h2>
                <p> I'm Punnee. A hair Stylist, a mom, a wife, and a lover of creating.<br>
                    My business is located inside Apollo Nail and Spa in Poulsbo, Washington. <br>
                    I've been doing hair for over a decade now. At first it started as a way to 
                    support my kids. But, then it grew into a passion I couldn't live without!<br>
                    I love everything about self care and I encourage my clients to think about 
                    inner beauty as well as outer beauty.     
                </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    "I've been going to see Punnee for years now, ever since she opened her business! Everything she's
                        done to my hair has come out fabulous. She really listens to what her customers want and makes sure 
                        everything is to their liking before they walk out her salon doors. "<br><br> -  Nora
                </li>
                 <li>
                    "Who could ask for a better hair stylist?! Punnee is wonderful and personable. I dont think I've ever
                        met a more genuine person. She treats everyone like family and really takes pride in her work. 5 stars from me!"<br><br> -  Leslie
                </li>
                 <li>
                    "If you want a hair stylist that is going to give you a basic cut for the cheapest price possible then
                        this is not the woman for you. While her prices are higher than a Super Cuts, it's well worth it to get 
                        her salon experience. She even massaged my head during shampooing! I definitely won't be going anywhere
                        else!"<br><br> -  Barbara
